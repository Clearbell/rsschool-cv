            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Studying at RS School now for me is realizing an old
              dream - to be able make web-sites. During my life I have worked
              in different companies in various professional fields such as 
              internet company technical support, civil servant, travel agent
              and assistant auditor. But everywhere I have always taken care
              of a company's sites with pleasure: filling content, adding
              new pages, making a new site with site-builders such a 
              <a href="http://wix.com">WIX</a>. So now as I have an opportunity to study this field thoroughly I’ll do my best.
              I consider this training as an opportunity to change my professional activities.
