### Summary
Studying at RS School now for me is realizing an old dream - to be able make web-sites.
During my life I have worked in different companies in various professional fields such as internet company technical support, civil servant, travel agent and assistant auditor. But everywhere I have always taken care of a company's sites with pleasure: filling content, adding new pages, making a new site with site-builders such a [WIX](wix.com).
So now as I have an opportunity to study this field thoroughly I’ll do my best. I consider this training as an opportunity to change my professional activities.
